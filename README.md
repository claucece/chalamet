# Chalamet

![Chalamet workflow](https://github.com/brave-experiments/frodo-pir/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

An implementation of the FrodoPIR Private Information Retrieval scheme. Find the details over [our eprint paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981.pdf).

We design *FrodoPIR*, a highly configurable, stateful, single-server Private Information Retrieval (PIR)
scheme that involves an offline phase that is completely client-independent. Coupled with small online
overheads, it leads to much smaller amortized financial costs on the server-side than previous approaches.
In terms of performance for a database of 1 million KB elements, FrodoPIR requires <1 second for
responding to a client query, has a server response size blow-up factor of > 3.6x, and financial costs are
~$1 for answering client queries. Our experimental analysis is built upon a simple, non-optimized
Rust implementation, illustrating that FrodoPIR is eminently suitable for large practical deployments.

*Warning*: This code is a research prototype. Do not use it in production.

## Requirements

In order to [natively](#native) build, run, test and benchmark the library, you will need the following:

```
  Rust >= 1.61.0
  Cargo
  Make
  Python3 >= 3.9.7
```

To obtain our performance numbers as reported in our paper, we run our benchmarks in AWS EC2 ``t2.t2xlarge`` and ``c5.9xlarge`` machines.

## Quickstart

### Local

#### Building

To install the latest version of Rust, use the following command (you can also check how to install on the [Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):

```
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

To build the library, run:

```
  make build
```

#### Testing

To run the tests:

```
  make test
```

We test:

* A client and server workflow when using Chalamet (internally with FrodoPIR) (10 times).
* A test to check that the library fails if parameters are reused.

If all test build and run correctly, you should see an `ok` next to them.

**Note**: Occasionally, one of the tests will fail with a `thread 'api::tests::client_query_to_server_10_times' panicked at 'assertion failed: (left == right)` error. This is due to the usage of specific parameters for testing and can be safely ignored.

#### Documentation

To view documentation (in a web browser manner):

```
  make docs
```

#### Benchmarking

To run a specific set of benchmarks, run (note the this process is slow. On average, it takes 12 minutes):

```
  make bench
```

This command will execute client query benchmarks and Database generation benchmarks (for more details, see the `benches/bench.rs` file).

To run all benchmarks (note that this process is very slow, it takes around 30 minutes):

```
  make bench-all
```

This command will execute client query benchmarks and Database generation benchmarks for 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 Number of DB items (log(m)). The results of these benchmarks can be found on Table 2 of our paper.

In order to see the results of the benchmarks, navigate to the `benchmarks-x-x.txt` file.

If all benches build and run correctly, you should see an `Finished ... benchmarks` under them.
We use [Criterion](https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/index.html) for benchmarking.
If you want to see and have explanations of the benchmarks, you can locally open `target/criterion/report/index.html` in your browser.

**Note**: When running the benches, a warning might appear ``Warning: Unable to complete 10 samples in 100.0s. You may wish to increase target time to 486.6s.``. If you want to silence the warning, you can change line 30 of `benches/bech.rs` file to 500 or more. Note that this will make the running of benches slower.

### Tests

We have two big tests that the library executes:

1. `client_kv_query_to_server_10_times` test which executes the client-to-server functionality:
   the client asks for an item in the database (by its key) and the server is able to privately return it.
   The test asserts that the returned item is indeed the correct item in the database.
   It executes a for loop 10 times.
2. `client_query_to_server_attempt_params_reuse` test which executes the client-to-server
   functionality one time. It asserts that once parameters for a query are used, they
   are marked as so, and cannot be reused.
